# Anatomy Quest

## Objective
The objective of this game is to get through the anatomy puzzle within the display room. The player needs to correctly guess which piece is currently presented on the clipboard. This can be accessed by pressing the Tab key. Guesses can be attempted by pressing the e key when close to a piece. There are 25 pieces in total. In order to help keep track of progress there is a complete checklist on one of the walls. This will update with correct guesses. Once the player guesses all of the pieces correctly, they will have completed the game. Starting the game again from the main menu will result in a new puzzle path order.
